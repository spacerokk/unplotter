# UnPlotter

**Extract numerical data from vector plots in PDF files**

UnPlotter is a browser-based tool that allows you to extract data from technical plots and graphs embedded in PDF documents. Simply load a PDF, calibrate the axes, select curves, and export the data as CSV or JSON.

## Features

- **100% Browser-Based** - No server required, all processing happens locally
- **PDF Support** - Load and navigate multi-page PDF documents
- **Vector Path Extraction** - Automatically extracts vector paths from PDFs
- **Axis Calibration** - Convert page coordinates to real data values
- **Linear or Logarithmic Axes** - Extract data from plots with linear or logarithmic axes
- **Curve Labeling** - Identify extracted curves with custom labels
- **Multiple Export Formats** - Download data as CSV or JSON
- **Privacy First** - Your files never leave your browser
- **Open Source** - MIT Licensed
- **Free** - Free to use, but contributions are appreciated if you find UnPlotter useful

## Use Cases
- Extract data from research papers and technical reports
- Digitize plots from legacy documents
- Recreate datasets for analysis, visualization, comparisons, etc.
- Archive plot data in machine-readable formats

## How It Works
1. **Load PDF** - Load a PDF file containing plots or graphs
1. **Navigate** - Browse pages and zoom/rotate to view your target plot
1. **Enable Selection** - Turn on selection mode to interact with plots
1. **Calibrate Axes** - Select reference lines for X and Y axes and enter their min/max values
1. **Label Curves** - Click on curves to select them and assign meaningful labels
1. **Export Data** - Download extracted data as CSV or JSON files

## Known Limitations
- Only works with vector-based plots (not raster images)
- Requires manual axis calibration
- Requires manual curve identification and labeling
- No support for polar plots
  - Extract linear data and transform in an external tool
- Some complex PDF operations may not extract paths correctly
  - Please report any issues you encounter with sample files if you can
